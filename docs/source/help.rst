Getting help & support 
=====

To request support please raise a query on the `LJMU Helpdesk <https://helpme.ljmu.ac.uk/#dashboard>`_. 
You can find the HPC query form under ITS Services -> High Performance Computing. Users not on the LJMU network can access the LJMU helpdesk by using the `Microsoft Remote Desktop Web Client <https://client.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/v2/index.html>`_.

FAQs
------

**Who runs the system?**

Prospero is hosted and administered by LJMU ITS. Specialist support for the system is also provided by a third party company, Alces Flight. Users do not liaise directly with Alces, but with ITS staff via the `LJMU Helpdesk <https://helpme.ljmu.ac.uk/#dashboard>`_. 

For academic/research questions rather than technical, please contact `Prof. Rob Crain <https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~astrcrai/>`_.

**I would like new software installing, how do I request this?**

System-wide package installs can be requested by raising a query on the `LJMU Helpdesk <https://helpme.ljmu.ac.uk/#dashboard>`_. Installs are usually completed within 48 hrs and made available to users via module files. 

**How do I copy large files to/from Prospero?**

We recommend using ``rsync``. If there is sufficient interest, we will investigate the establishment of a Globus Endpoint on the gateway node.
