History

Prospero is a collective response to the growth of a number of independent HPC facilities for research within LJMU (particularly those of the Astrophysics Research Institute, the School of Engineering, and the School of Biological Sciences), each of which outgrew the capabilities of the local infrastructure for power and cooling. Migration to a consolidated, centralised solution hosted in the university's primary data centre has enabled the development of a facility with capacity and capability significantly beyond those of department-specific facilities.

**Initial system:**

* Development of a new system was catalysed by the award of two major research grants to the ARI in 2018/19, from the European Research Council and the Royal Society, and enabling an ambitious facility to be planned. 
* HPE, in collaboration with UK vendors DTP, were approached to provide a design proposal meeting the broad requirements of the university's research base.
* An initial system comprising 20 standard compute nodes, a memory-rich compute node, and 80TB of NFS storage saw `first light' in August 2020. 

**Major updates:**
* WCL compure nodes
* RCIF storage
* RCIF accelerated
* ARI QR
