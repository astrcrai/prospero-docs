Getting access
===============

Eligible LJMU staff and students (see :ref:`Policies`) wishing to obtain an account on Prospero should submit a ticket to the HPC section of the `LJMU IT Helpdesk <https://helpme.ljmu.ac.uk/>`_, to request the creation of an account. 

Per the usage policy, research collaborators at external institutions with a genuine need to use Prospero may also obtain an account. They must first register with LJMU Human resources as an ``external consultant`` in order to obtain an ITS account, after which their LJMU sponsor may request the creation of a Prospero account for them via the helpdesk.
