   28/07/2025 - Phase-2 of Prospero is underway. The first 13 nodes with the `Prospero-2 specification <https://prospero-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications.html>`_ have been installed and are available in the compute and long SLURM partitions. There are important implications for how job submission scripts should be written.
